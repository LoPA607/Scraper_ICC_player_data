Virat Kohli,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/virat-kohli-253802,"Virat Kohli player profile
India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.
This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.
Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in one-day internationals.
An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection.
Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.
Virat Kohli IPL factfile
- Virat Kohli is the only player in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to have played all seasons for one team:Royal Challengers Bangalore(RCB)
- He was picked by RCB soon after he captained India to victory in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and has been retained by them ever since
- Kohli is the IPL's highest run-scorer and the only one with more than 8000 runs
- He holds the record for most IPL centuries (8) as well as most runs in a season (973 runs in 2016). He has won the Orange Cap twice - in 2016 and 2024
- Kohli captained RCB full-time from 2013 to 2021 and led them to the final in the 2016 season, when they lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad
- Kohli holds the record for the most prolific partnerships in the IPL, with AB de Villiers (3123 runs) and Chris Gayle (2787 runs)
- His popularity has made RCB one of the most followed teams in the IPL, even though they haven't yet won a title"
Shikhar Dhawan,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/shikhar-dhawan-28235,"Shikhar Dhawan IPL factfile
- Shikhar Dhawan is the first man to hit back-to-back centuries in the IPL.
- Dhawan holds the record for hitting most fours in the IPL.
- He is only behind Virat Kohli in aggregate runs.
- Dhawan won the IPL with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2016.
- SRH are one of the four teams Dhawan has represented; the others are both the Delhi franchises Delhi Daredevils (DD) and Delhi Capitals (DC), the other Hyderabad franchise Deccan Chargers, Mumbai Indians (MI) andPunjab Kings(PBKS).
- Dhawan has captained both PBKS and SRH. No Indian has led more than two teams.
Shikhar Dhawan player profile
Shikhar Dhawan stunned all observers, and Australia, when he stroked his way to the fastest Test century by a debutant. That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.
Dhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s. He stands upright in his stance, is a bit stiff with his hands when he pushes forward, and is partial to the cover-drive. Those who played domestic cricket with him say he is supremely confident, bordering on showmanship. He is also a flamboyant personality with his ever-changing looks and the twirled moustache.
However, the attractive strokes, which were apparent even in the 2003-04 Under-19 World Cup where he was the Player of the Tournament for scoring 505 runs at 84.16 with three centuries, didn't seem to translate into huge seasons in Ranji Trophy. His average stayed steady in the mid-40s, but he didn't quite dare the selectors to overlook him. After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues.
Fortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days. He was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy soon after, and carried his sizzling form into that tournament with two centuries in the side's first two matches.
Dhawan's form later tailed off in England and Australia in 2014 but he hit back with 412 runs at 51.50 in India's run to the 2015 World Cup semi-finals.Sidharth Monga"

Rohit Sharma,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/rohit-sharma-34102,"Rohit Sharma player profile
Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.
That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word ""talent"" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.
Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double.
Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him ""Hitman"" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.
His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022.
Rohit Sharma IPL factfile
- Rohit Sharma has won six IPL titles: one with Deccan Chargers and five as captain ofMumbai Indians(MI), making him the joint most successful captain in the Indian Premier League.
- He joined Mumbai in 2011 and became captain in 2013. He took them to their maiden IPL title in his first season as captain and went on to lead MI for 11 years before he was replaced by Hardik Pandya for the 2024 season.
- Rohit is MI's top-scorer and one of only four batters with more than 6000 runs in the IPL. His only hundred - 109* against Kolkata Knight Riders - came in IPL 2012.
- Rohit's best IPL season with the bat was in 2013, when he scored 538 runs in MI's title-winning campaign. In 2015, Rohit was the Player of the Final as Mumbai beat Chennai Super Kings to win their second IPL title. MI went on to win the IPL in 2017, 2019 and 2020 under Rohit's leadership"

Yashasvi Jaiswal,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/yashasvi-jaiswal-1151278,"Yashasvi Jaiswal player profile
From his Under-19 days, Yashasvi Jaiswal has come to embody fearlessness and a robust batting approach, to which he has also managed to add consistency, as his record in the IPL and in domestic cricket for Mumbai in the early 2020s shows.
At 12, Jaiswal moved from rural Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai for cricket. He slept in tents and soldpani purito earn pocket money. When Jwala Singh, a local coach, took him under his wing two years later, after watching him at Azad Maidan, Jaiswal's career began to take off.
In October 2019, in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the 50-overs domestic competition, Jaiswal racked up scores of 113, 22, 122, 203 and 60 not out, his run only coming to an end when rain knocked Mumbai out of the competition. The following year, he was India's batting mainstay in the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, where he was the Player of the Tournament and the team finished runners-up. That paved the way for a big payday at the IPL, where he was signed for Rs 2.4 crore (about US$ 338,000) by Rajasthan Royals.
The step up from tearing apart domestic bowlers and lording it over U-19 attacks wasn't quite smooth, but hard work and long hours spent working on his technique and skills at the Royals academy when training opened up after Covid helped his confidence, Jaiswal said. In his first full Ranji Trophy season, 2021-22, he made three successive hundreds in Mumbai's run to the final.
At Royals, where he was retained ahead of the 2022 season, Jaiswal has formed a fearsome opening combination with Jos Buttler.  In the 2023 IPL, he set a new record for the fastest fifty in the tournament's history, off just 13 balls.
Yashasvi Jaiswal IPL factfile
- In 2023, Yashasvi Jaiswal scored the fastest fifty in IPL cricket: off 13 balls, forRajasthan Royals(RR) against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).
- Spotted early and nurtured by Royals, Jaiswal became their youngest centurion at 21 years and 123 days in 2023, with 124 against Mumbai Indians (MI).
- That Jaiswal 124 also equalled the record for the highest individual score by a Royals batter, and broke the record for the highest IPL score by an uncapped player."
Sachin Tendulkar,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/sachin-tendulkar-35320,"Sachin Tendulkar was the most complete batter of his time, the most prolific run-maker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known.
His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to genius batters - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke (though the upright, back-foot punch comes close) it was because he was proficient at so many and could pull them out at will.
There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both feet, could temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world, in all conditions.
Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in that country. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batter: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.
Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and driven by a loathing for defeat, Tendulkar established his greatness early. He was only 16 when he made his Test debut, and was hit in the face by Waqar Younis in that game, but continued to bat. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batter to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs, 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.
He holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred until his 79th match. At just under 37 years of age, he made the first double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, a month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which, like Bradman's batting average, might be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, he retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, against West Indies.
Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectation he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who were prone to regarding anything less than a hundred in every innings as a failure. He still remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."

- He blitzed 46 off 19 balls on his IPL debut against RCB but spent only one season at Delhi, before joining Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2019, where he has remained ever since.
- In IPL 2024, Abhishek smashed the fastest IPL fifty for Sunrisers, off 16 balls, as they amassed the highest total in IPL history - 277 - against Mumbai Indians.
Abhishek Sharma player profile
A clean striker of the ball with a solid game against pace and spin, Abhishek Sharma started off in the middle order but made a smooth transition to the top three for Punjab in domestic cricket and for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL. He's also a handy left-arm spinner who can surprise batters with his backspinning legcutter.
He made a name for himself in age-group cricket, first as the leading run-scorer in the Vijay Merchant domestic Under-16 tournament in 2015-16 (where he made an incredible 1200 runs in seven matches), and the next season as India's captain when they won the U-19 Asia Cup title. He also was an integral part of India's U-19 World Cup-winning squad in 2018, scoring 50 and taking 2 for 11 against Bangladesh in the quarter-final.
Delhi Daredevils picked him up in the 2018 auction and he smashed 46 off 19 balls in his first IPL game, but lost momentum for a few seasons after that. In 2022, in his fourth season with Sunrisers Hyderabad, Abhishek, now settled in the top order, scored 426 runs at a strike rate of 133. Most memorably, he took 34 off 15 Rashid Khan deliveries in a match against eventual champions Gujarat Titans.
A year later, he made 485 runs, with two hundreds and three half-centuries while striking at over 180, as Punjab won their first Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 trophy. Earlier in the tournament, his 112 off 51 balls against Andhra Pradesh powered Punjab to 275 for 6, a tournament record.
Another record total followed in the 2024 IPL when he smashed 63 off 23 balls taking Sunrisers to 277 for 3, the highest in IPL history.
Still, Abhishek isn't just a limited-overs prospect. On his Ranji Trophy debut in 2017, he scored 94 from No. 8, and In December 2022 he made his first first-class hundred in a draw against Chandigarh."
"Ahmed, KK",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/khaleel-ahmed-942645,"A left-arm medium pacer and opening bowler for India Under-19s, Khaleel Ahmed has been a dependable performer at the youth level.

He couldn't quite extend that wicket-taking form into the World Cup, but was a regular presence in the side.

Akash Deep,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/akash-deep-1176959,"Akash Deep's is the ideal story of how years of toil gets you a dream Test debut where Rahul Dravid hands you the cap, and in the first hour of the game, you run through the opposition's top order.
Hailing from Sasaram in Bihar, Akash was initially dissuaded to play cricket by his father, but he left for Durgapur, West Bengal, in 2010 with the pretext of finding a job and found support from his uncle to join a local cricket academy. Soon, he started gaining prominence for his pace, but Akash was struck by family tragedies, when he lost his father and older brother within the space of two months. That forced him to leave the game for three years.
Akash, however, didn't give up and moved to Kolkata where he started with the United Club in CAB's Second Division League. He also met Mohammed Shami in the city and after working on his fitness he progressed from the mid-130s to bowling long spells with more pace. In 2019, he made it to the Bengal Under-23 side and the same year gave him his senior debut for Bengal in all three formats. In just his second first-class game, Akash bagged a six-for, against Gujarat, on his way to 35 wickets in the season at an average of 18.02 in Bengal's run to the Ranji final.
He continued to pick wickets with the white ball as well, which got him his maiden IPL deal with RCB in 2021. The year 2023 turned out to be a big year for him. He started the year with a 10-for against Haryana in a Ranji game and grabbed a five-for in the semi-final against Madhya Pradesh to be named the Player of the Match. Bengal went down in the final again, but Akash had risen through India's premier first-class competition to bag 41 wickets, this time the most for his team.

Arshdeep Singh,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/arshdeep-singh-1125976,"Arshdeep Singh player profile
Arshdeep is one of only three Indian bowlers, after Jhulan Goswami and Ajit Agarkar, to start his T20I career with a maiden over. A death-overs specialist known for his accurate yorkers and 140kph-plus deliveries, he made his international debut in England in 2022.
That debut, though, was several years in the making. Arshdeep was part of the 2018 title-winning Under-19 World Cup squad, and his three wickets in two matches at an economy of 2 were the beginning of a golden year for him. He made his List A debut for Punjab, got picked up by Punjab Kings in the IPL auction, and took an eight-for in an U-23 match against Rajasthan.
He had two quiet IPL seasons - he picked up three wickets in three games in 2019, and nine in eight in 2020 - but PBKS backed him. He repaid their faith by taking 18 in the 2021 season, when he was the side's second highest wicket-taker, and 17 in 2023, the most for the franchise that year.
After his T20I debut in England, Arshdeep took seven wickets in in five games against West Indies, a performance that got him into the 2022 T20 Asia Cup, where he was the only bowler other than Bhuvneshwar Kumar to pick up more than four wickets. He did even better at the T20 World Cup later that year, where he was India's top wicket-taker. In his first game, in front of 90,000 spectators at the MCG, Arshdeep produced a spell for the ages, removing Babar Azam with an inswinger with his first ball and sending back Mohammad Rizwan with a searing bouncer to leave Pakistan at 15 for 2.
In ODIs, he went wicketless in his first series, against New Zealand in 2022, but picked up his first international five-for against South Africa in 2023, starring in India's series win with ten wickets at a remarkable economy of 3.51.
Arshdeep Singh IPL factfile
- A member of the India team that won the Under-19 World Cup in 2018, Arshdeep Singh was bought by Punjab Kings (PBKS, then Kings XI Punjab) for his base price of INR 20 lakh ahead of IPL 2019.
- After just three appearances in his debut season, Arshdeep played eight games and picked up nine wickets in IPL 2020 at an economy rate of 8.77.
- IPL 2021 was his breakout season, as Arshdeep picked up 18 wickets from 12 games. His knack of nailing yorkers from his left-armer's angle made him a gun bowler at the death for Punjab. He also returned his career-best T20 figures of 5 for 32, against Rajasthan Royals, that season.
- Arshdeep was retained by Punjab Kings for INR 4 crore ahead of the IPL 2022 auction, and ended the season with ten wickets at an economy rate of 7.70. His performances earned him a spot in the India squad in the 2022 T20 World Cup too.
- He had another good season in 2023, taking 17 wickets, even though Arshdeep was more expensive than in earlier seasons, going at 9.69. He is a part of Punjab Kings in IPL 2024 too."
"Ashwin, R",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/ravichandran-ashwin-26421,"R Ashwin player profile
R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly thesodukuball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century.
All through his career Ashwin has been a cricket nerd with a deep appreciation of the nuances of the game and an acute knowledge of his craft. And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it.
His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.
Among the highlights of Ashwin's Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.
Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the public's reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.
He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in India's run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.
An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with multiple Test hundreds to his name.
R Ashwin IPL factfile
- Offspinner R Ashwin has played for five IPL teams since his debut season in 2009, and his most recent franchise is Rajasthan Royals (RR), whom he has been playing for since 2022.
- With 171 wickets before the start of IPL 2024, Ashwin is among the top-five wicket-takers in IPL history.
- Ashwin began his IPL career at Chennai Super Kings (CSK), whom he represented from 2008 to 2015. In the 2011 IPL final between CSK and RCB, MS Dhoni gave Ashwin the new ball and he took the key wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Ashwin's 20 wickets in 2011 is his highest tally in an IPL season to date.
- After CSK were banned for two years following corruption charges, Ashwin played IPL 2016 for Rising Pune Supergiant and missed 2017 because of injury, before moving to Kings XI Punjab (KXIP, now Punjab Kings).
- Ashwin was captain of KXIP from 2018, and in 2019 his mankading (run-out of the non-striker backing-up) of RR batter Jos Buttler became a subject of heated debate.
- Ahead of IPL 2020, Ashwin was traded to Delhi Capitals, where he spent two seasons before moving to RR in 2022. At Royals, he was used up the order as a pinch-hitter and became the first batter to retire out tactically in an IPL game."
Avesh Khan,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/avesh-khan-694211,"A tall right-arm quick with a high arm action, Avesh Khan made his name through two Under-19 World Cups and graduated to the senior level after impressing with his variations, seam movement, and slower deliveries.
Avesh made his first-class debut for Madhya Pradesh (MP) a week before he turned 18, after being groomed by former India player Amay Khurasiya, his childhood coach. Khurasiya had spotted a 13-year-old Avesh at a Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association trial and, a few years later, the quick was opening the bowling for India Under-19s. His rise to the senior level continued when he got his first IPL deal in 2017, with RCB, and he topped the wicket-taking charts for MP in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy with 35 wickets at 16.37, which included a seven-for against Hyderabad. It earned him an India A call-up in early 2019 and for the Duleep Trophy later in the year.
His breakthrough IPL campaign came in 2021 when Avesh claimed 24 wickets, second on the overall charts, in DC's run to the playoffs. That version of Avesh impressed in all phases of the game as he displayed improved pace and control and more yorkers in the death overs. He soon flew to England as one of the standbys for the WTC final and five Tests in England. Later in 2021, Avesh got his maiden India call-up after being among the net bowlers for the T20 World Cup, although the debut had to wait till 2022.
A week before his international debut, however, Avesh became a millionaire when LSG paid a whopping Rs 10 crore for him at the 2022 auction, making him the most expensive uncapped Indian in auction history at the time. His form continued in the following IPL, and an ODI debut came in the Caribbean, where he won India games in both white-ball formats.
But 2023 wasn't as kind to him. The wickets dried up and he leaked runs in the IPL before he worked on his fitness and his bowling with Anand Rajan, his close confidant, to return to the T20I and ODI sides at the end of 2023."
"Bharat, KS",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/srikar-bharat-529436,"KS Bharat did not keep wicket in a match until his last year in Under-19 cricket. From there, he had to compete with Wriddhiman Saha, an immaculate gloveman, and Rishabh Pant, a maverick batter, for a spot in India's Test side.
Bharat got his first India call-up in November 2019 but had to wait till February 2023 for his debut. That too came only because Pant was unavailable after his car accident. In between, he kept as a substitute - and took two catches and effected one stumping - when Saha had a stiff neck during the Kanpur Test against New Zealand in 2021.
Bharat's first five Tests were against Australia: four in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at home and the other, the World Test Championship final at The Oval. He showed glimpses of brilliance behind the stumps but was not consistent. With the bat, he failed to convert his starts. As a result, he was dropped midway through the England series at home in early 2024.
In domestic cricket, Bharat was the first wicketkeeper-batter to score a triple-hundred in the Ranji Trophy. Opening for Andhra, he smashed 308 off 311 balls against Goa in Ongole in the 2014-15 season. That was also the first triple-hundred by an Andhra batter in first-class cricket.
A few days later, Delhi Daredevils bought him ahead of IPL 2015. But he did not get a game and was released after the season. His next IPL stint was in 2021, for Royal Challengers Bangalore. In the following three years, he was part of three different franchises - Delhi Capitals in 2022, Gujarat Titans in 2023, and Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024 - but barely got any opportunities."

Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him.
Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.
A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title.
Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.ESPNcricinfo staff
Jasprit Bumrah IPL factfile
- Jasprit Bumrah is one of the key players in Mumbai Indians' (MI) rise to becoming five-time champions in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is their second-highest wicket-taker after Lasith Malinga.
- Bumrah was spotted by MI after just one season of domestic T20 cricket and signed as an uncapped player ahead of IPL 2013. He played just two matches in his debut season and his first IPL wicket was that of Virat Kohli. His 100th IPL wicket, in IPL 2020, was also that of Kohli.
- Since 2014, Bumrah has been a key part of the MI bowling unit and has grown to become its undisputed leader. With his unique action and high pace, Bumrah possesses a bagful of variations and a lethally accurate yorker, and is a force in every stage of the game.
- Bumrah was MI's highest wicket-taker in three of their IPL title wins, taking 20 wickets in 2017, 19 in 2019, and 27 in 2020. He was also part of the squad when Mumbai won titles in 2013 and 2015, though he didn't play many games because he was new in 2013 and injured in 2015."

Deshpande came through by picking wickets in the Cooch Behar Trophy and started his first-class career with a bang, in 2016-17, when he bagged 19 wickets in his first five Ranji Trophy games and ended the season with a tally of 21 when Mumbai finished as runners-up. He was also handy with the white ball, proven by his tally of 15 in eight games when Mumbai lifted the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2018-19. He was, however, on the fringes of the Mumbai set-up and got chances mainly when one of Shardul Thakur or Dhawal Kulkarni was unavailable. A no-ball problem also affected his consistency. He became a regular feature after the 2018-19 season when he was also picked for the Duleep Trophy and made his IPL debut in 2020 for Delhi Capitals (DC). After he blew hot and cold that season, he was picked up by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the mega auction in 2022, which gave him only two match opportunities.
He turned his IPL fortunes around in 2023 when he became CSK's go-to seamer after Dwayne Bravo retired and Deepak Chahar was injured. Deshpande also worked on his yorkers and death bowling that year and played all 16 games to emerge as their top wicket-taker, with 21, in their victorious campaign. He followed it with another 17 scalps in IPL 2024 while also playing a pivotal role Mumbai's Ranji Trophy-winning season with 15 wickets and his maiden-first class century, in five games.

Within his first year of white-ball debut in domestic cricket, Dube had started hitting boundaries in the lower order and picking wickets. His Ranji Trophy debut also put him in the spotlight when he bagged a five-for to dismiss five of Karnataka's top six batters, combined with a brisk 71 down the order. But the headline moment came when he smashed five sixes in an over off Pravin Tambe in a Mumbai T20 league game and repeated the feat in a Ranji match against Baroda, just a day before the IPL auction in December 2018. That season, Dube had also taken a seven-for against Karnataka and struck his maiden first-class century. Those shot his value up so much that RCB splurged Rs 5 crore for him. However, he couldn't prove to be the finisher RCB wanted him to be for two seasons and he switched to Rajasthan Royals for the 2020 season.
Despite the IPL form, he shone for India A across formats in 2019, especially in crisis situations, which impressed the selectors enough to pick him for a home T20I series when Hardik Pandya was unavailable, especially after they had looked beyond Vijay Shankar in the aftermath of the 2019 ODI World Cup. Dube scored his maiden T20I fifty in his fourth innings, when he was promoted to No. 3, but his IPL stock was yet to take off.
Dube's fortunes - both in the IPL and for India - rose to giddying heights after he was bought by CSK for Rs 4 crore in 2022. They groomed him as a six-hitting specialist in the middle overs, especially to take on spinners. He hammered 16 fours and 22 fours to finish the 2022 season with a strike rate of 156.21, and he followed his 289 runs that year with 418 in 2023 and 396 in 2024, striking them at 158.33 and 162.30 respectively. It earned him a berth for the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he was far from his best (133 runs with a strike rate of under 115), but he was part of an unbeaten victorious campaign.
He also excelled in the red-ball format in 2024, scoring two attacking centuries to average nearly 68 and taking 12 wickets at just 12.08 in Mumbai's title-winning Ranji run.

Ruturaj Gaikwad player profile
Ruturaj Gaikwad entered the Indian cricket fan's consciousness with a bang in 2021, when he made a whopping 635 runs for title winners Chennai Super Kings. The previous season the franchise had taken a punt on Gaikwad as one for the future, slotting him in as an anchoring opener who could attack when needed. They gave him six games and he showed what he was capable of, with over 200 runs.
Towards the pointy end of the 2021 tournament, Gaikwad made 70 in the qualifier against Delhi Capitals and put on a partnership of 61 with Faf du Plessis in the final, taking CSK to 192, which turned out to be plenty. Fresh off that success, he captained Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and made 259 runs.
Gaikwad's first-class, List A and T20 debuts came in 2016-17, and he shone in the middle format, with 444 runs, the third highest in the Vijay Hazare Trophy that year. He showed he had the game for all requirements when he produced 187 not out against Sri Lanka A in a List A game June 2019, and later in the year, a hundred and a fifty against Chhatisgarh in the Ranji Trophy."

In his case, it was thanks to Kolkata Knight Riders' scouting system. With height, pace, hit-the-deck skills and clever variations to his credit, Harshit was fast-tracked into the India squad in July 2024, after having won the IPL with KKR.
Harshit was 20 when - on the advice of Nitish Rana, who also hails from Delhi - KKR brought him on board as a replacement for the injured Rasikh Salam in 2022. Later that year, Harshit made his first-class and List A debuts as well, showcasing his ability to adapt with the red ball with 21 wickets in five first-class Ranji Trophy games that season.
By June 2023 he had been picked for the Duleep Trophy, where he showed he had something to offer with the bat too, cracking an unbeaten 122 off 86 balls from No. 9, studded with nine sixes, for North Zone. Harshit was also part of the India A side at the ACC Emerging Men's Cup, where he opened the bowling and picked up seven wickets in five games. That he was getting closer to an India call-up became clear when he toured South Africa for an India A series in 2023-24, the A side shadowing the senior team.
His terrific 2023 culminated in an IPL trophy in 2024; he was KKR's joint-second-highest wicket-taker, and fourth overall in the tournament, with 19 scalps spread across the three innings phases and an enviable economy rate of 9.85 in the death overs in an extremely high-scoring tournament.ESPNcricinfo staff"

Shreyas Iyer is an attacking top-order batter capable of marrying classical shots with brute force.
He made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for Rs 2.6 crore (about US$416,000). It was faith he repaid with interest: he made 439 runs that season, and won the IPL Emerging Player of the Year award. Over the next six seasons, he became a mainstay of the side and its captain, making over 400 runs a season for them four times.
Iyer came up through the Under-19 ranks, hitting back-to-back fifties in the 2014 World Cup playoffs to help India finish fifth. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai the next domestic season, and after a lukewarm stint in the middle order, was promoted to opener and finished as the team's top run-getter with 809 runs at an average of over 50. He had a blow-out Ranji Trophy season the next year, with 1321 runs at 73, and made a century in the final, where Mumbai won their 41st title.
By then calls for Iyer to be fast-tracked into the India side had grown clamorous, but it took nearly another two years before he made his international debut, in the white-ball formats first. His first hundred for India came in an ODI against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2020, and he made a century and fifty on Test debut against the same side a little over a year and a half later, this time at home. In a Ranchi ODI in October 2022, he made a chase of 282 against South Africa look like a walk in a park with a well-paced unbeaten 113 that took India home with plenty of room to spare.
Shreyas Iyer IPL factfile
- After missing IPL 2023 with a back injury, Shreyas Iyer has returned to lead Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2024, though he has continued to have issues with his back.
- Iyer, a middle-order batter who excels against spin, joined KKR in IPL 2022 as their captain after spending his first seven IPL seasons at Delhi Capitals (DC).
- He was named Emerging Player of the Year for scoring 436 runs in his debut IPL season in 2015, and in 2018 he replaced Gautam Gambhir as DC captain after the season had begun.
- In 2019, Iyer led DC to the IPL playoffs for the first time after six years, and in 2020 he captained them to their first IPL final, where they lost to Mumbai Indians.
- Iyer missed the first half of IPL 2021 because of a shoulder injury, and when he returned for the second half of the season, DC decided to continue with Rishabh Pant as their captain. Iyer left DC at the end of that season and began his KKR career the following year."
"Jadeja, RA",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/ravindra-jadeja-234675,"Ravindra Jadeja player profile
Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling.
In October 2019 he became the quickest left-arm bowler to reach 200 Test wickets. Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012.
In an era in which he was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, Jadeja kept his senior colleague on his toes, and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just the one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batter.
Some of his best batting performances came against the top teams, and they were often accompanied by the swordsman's celebration that became his signature. Ten years into his career, he had five Test fifties and a hundred against England - the latter in a partnership of 222 with Rishabh Pant at Edgbaston in 2022 - and four half-centuries against Australia. It was all a far cry from the memes his batting inspired at the start of his career - though the ridicule directed at his three triple-hundreds in domestic cricket back then was more an indictment of the quality of bowling on the Indian first-class circuit at the time.
Jadeja shone in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win, finishing as the leading wicket-taker, with 12 wickets, two of those in the final, where he also made an unbeaten 33.
His most valuable assets as a bowler are perhaps his fitness and strength, which enable him to go at batters for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch. Like with his batting, his bowling highlights too feature the best sides disproportionately. His first Test five-for came against Australia in Delhi in 2013, and was followed by 6 for 138 in his next match, against South Africa in Durban, though that was in an India defeat. When South Africa next visited India, he got stuck into them, with 23 wickets in the four Tests in 2015. Against England at home in 2016-17, he harvested 26; this included an impressive demolition job in Chennai, where he took 7 for 48 after India had racked up 759 runs. Later that season he took 25 wickets when Australia visited for four Tests, to go with the 24 from the previous time, in 2013.
Through the first half of his career and beyond, Jadeja's place in the Test side was never quite secure. He had to fight through a serious shoulder injury, and he was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. Of course, these hardships paled in comparison with a tough childhood in Jamnagar, and the hard knocks that marked his early career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary. In that tournament, Jadeja has been synonymous with Chennai Super Kings, for whom he has taken over 100 wickets over nine seasons and whom he briefly captained in 2022.
Ravindra Jadeja IPL factfile
- Ravindra Jadeja has won the IPL final four times, once with Rajasthan Royals (RR) and three times withChennai Super Kings(CSK).
- He was the Player of the Match in CSK's thrilling win in 2023 when he hit a four off the last ball of the match.
- The late Shane Warne marked him out as a future superstar when he captained the 19-year-old Jadeja in 2008, nicknaming him ""Rockstar"".
- Jadeja is CSK's second-highest wicket-taker in the IPL, behind only Dwayne Bravo (140).
- He was handed the CSK captaincy in 2022, but stepped down mid-season and MS Dhoni took the reins again. CSK finished joint-bottom of the table that year.

From his Under-19 days, Yashasvi Jaiswal has come to embody fearlessness and a robust batting approach, to which he has also managed to add consistency, as his record in the IPL and in domestic cricket for Mumbai in the early 2020s shows.
At 12, Jaiswal moved from rural Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai for cricket. He slept in tents and soldpani purito earn pocket money. When Jwala Singh, a local coach, took him under his wing two years later, after watching him at Azad Maidan, Jaiswal's career began to take off.
In October 2019, in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the 50-overs domestic competition, Jaiswal racked up scores of 113, 22, 122, 203 and 60 not out, his run only coming to an end when rain knocked Mumbai out of the competition. The following year, he was India's batting mainstay in the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, where he was the Player of the Tournament and the team finished runners-up. That paved the way for a big payday at the IPL, where he was signed for Rs 2.4 crore (about US$ 338,000) by Rajasthan Royals.
The step up from tearing apart domestic bowlers and lording it over U-19 attacks wasn't quite smooth, but hard work and long hours spent working on his technique and skills at the Royals academy when training opened up after Covid helped his confidence, Jaiswal said. In his first full Ranji Trophy season, 2021-22, he made three successive hundreds in Mumbai's run to the final.
At Royals, where he was retained ahead of the 2022 season, Jaiswal has formed a fearsome opening combination with Jos Buttler.  In the 2023 IPL, he set a new record for the fastest fifty in the tournament's history, off just 13 balls.

- In 2023, Yashasvi Jaiswal scored the fastest fifty in IPL cricket: off 13 balls, forRajasthan Royals(RR) against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).

Jurel was born in a lower-middle-class family. His mother had to sell her gold chain to buy him his first cricket kit but things soon took a positive turn.

Armed with a ferocious slog sweep and gifted hitting-ability, Harmanpreet has modeled her aggressive style of play on that of her idol Virender Sehwag.
She represents the new-age India women's cricketer, part of a generation that has been at the center of ad campaigns, endorsements, central contracts and pay-parity with the men. Her stocks rose overseas as well. She became the first India cricketer - male or female - to sign a Big Bash League contract with Sydney Thunder in Australia. The deal came about on the back of an impressive showing during India's tour of Australia in January 2016, where she made a 31-ball 46 to script India's highest-ever T20 chase. In June 2017, she became the first Indian to sign with Surrey Stars in ECB's Kia Super League.
Harmanpreet broke through in 2009, but it wasn't until 2013 that she stamped her class. Her century against England at the Women's World Cup at home, albeit in a losing cause, earned plaudits from opposition captain Charlotte Edwards. Her career graph has skyrocketed since. In April 2013, she was handed the captaincy of the Indian ODI team when Mithali Raj was rested for the limited-overs series against Bangladesh. She got the job full-time across formats in 2016 in the wake of a disappointing T20 World Cup campaign where India crashed out of the group stages.
The high point of her India captaincy came in 2020 when she led the side to the final of the T20 World Cup against Australia in front of a record 86,174 fans at MCG. Three years on, she ushered in a new era in Indian women's cricket by leading Mumbai Indians to the inaugural WPL crown."

India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.
This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.
Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in one-day internationals.
An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection.
Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.

Kuldeep Yadav,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/kuldeep-yadav-559235,"Kuldeep Yadav player profile
Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.
There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.
Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. ""As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),"" he said after the match.
He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.
Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after.
Having established himself in the Uttar Pradesh and India A sides, Kuldeep made his Test debut against Australia in a deciding match in Dharamsala in March 2017 and claimed 4 for 68 in the first innings.ESPNcricinfo staff
Kuldeep Yadav IPL factfile
- Kuldeep Yadav is the most successful left-arm wristspinner in the IPL.
- He was first introduced by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2016 in a continuation of their faith in left-arm wristspin, first starting alongside Brad Hogg and then replacing the veteran Australian.
- His form fell away in the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and he missed IPL 2021 due to a knee injury before being let go by KKR.
- In 2022, after six seasons with KKR, he was picked byDelhi Capitals(DC). The move seemed to work for him, 2022 being his most prolific IPL season: he took 21 wickets at a strike rate of 14.19, finishing in the tournament's top-five wicket-takers."
"Mandhana, S",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/smriti-mandhana-597806,"Smriti Mandhana bats with the grace that is typical of left-handers and its also brought her runs all over the world. Over time, Mandhana has added a power game, with a pull shot comparable with some of the best ever. Her consistency over long periods has made her among the top batters; attributes that have also made her arguably among the most marketable female athletes in India.
A prodigy, Mandhana made her senior team debut for Maharashtra as a 13-year-old, and graduated to captaining the team at 16. An international debut in the same year (2013) was the start of a journey in which she has broken the ceiling repeatedly.
In 2014, she celebrated her Test debut with a half-century in a historic win over England in Wormsley. In 2017, she struck 90 on ODI World Cup debut, in a tournament where India spurred a revolution by making the final. In between, she became the face of the women's T20 revolution in India long before the Women's Premier League was conceived, becoming only the second Indian to sign a franchise deal, with WBBL team Brisbane Heat.
Among all the runs and records she has racked up, Mandhana's biggest achievement to date must undoubtedly be the WPL 2024 title she delivered as captain for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, whose bid of INR 3.4 crore (USD 415,000 approx then) made her the costliest signing prior to the inaugural edition."
Mohammed Siraj,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/mohammed-siraj-940973,"Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand.
Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up, which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up.
Potential translated to performance when he was his state's highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017. The step up to the big league arrived soon after."
Mukesh Kumar,https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/mukesh-kumar-926851,"With his all-format international debut in the Caribbean in 2023, Mukesh Kumar was among the bowlers next in line after the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. He is also among the rare breed of bowlers who got his maiden India call-up before playing a single IPL game.
Mukesh was picked by the Cricket Association of Bengal in their trials when he had not even played club cricket. When he had moved from Bihar, his home state, in 2014, he was primarily a tennis-ball cricket player who would get tired easily and the doctors had said he was anemic. He was later also diagnosed with bone edema in his knees but over time he gained considerable strength while working under Ranadeb Bose and Waqar Younis. After a few years of training, fitness regimes, and getting his food and sleep habits right, Mukesh became a vital part of the Bengal pace attack with Akash Deep and Ishan Porel.
Mukesh made an impact on his first-class debut at the age of 22 with a four-for against Haryana that included the big scalp of Virender Sehwag. He became a regular in the Bengal side from the 2018-19 season - when he became much fitter - bagging 22 wickets, the second-most for his team, in five matches. He added another 32 wickets next season, with two five-fors, in Bengal's run to the Ranji Trophy final. His wickets in the semi-final against Karnataka included KL Rahul, Devdutt Padikkal, Karun Nair and Manish Pandey.
In the absence of a Ranji season in Covid-19, he continued to pick up wickets with his swing and skiddy bowling in the white-ball formats. In September 2022, he picked up five wickets on his India A debut against New Zealand A on a high-scoring pitch. He then picked up four wickets with the new ball in the Irani Cup and then toured Bangladesh for another A tour to bag a six-for.
He was selected in India's second-string T20I side just after the 2022 T20 World Cup, which didn't result in a debut, but it was in 2023 that he got his maiden IPL deal, with Delhi Capitals for Rs 5.50 crore, and then his debut for India in the three formats within a span of 14 days, the shortest span in which an India player made his debut across formats. Such was his rise that he had played 18 matches for India by the time 2023 ended."

His 1237 runs there at an average of 176.41 still remains the record highest tally in the tournament's history, and earned him the BCCI's award for best U-16 cricketer that season. As he developed his bowling as a seamer, he also took the new ball for Andhra in senior domestic cricket, and his all-round skills earned the interest of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL. Before the 2023 IPL season, he was bought by SRH for INR 20 lakhs, but in his debut season, bowled five wicketless overs across two games while not getting to bat. However, in IPL 2024, his exploits earned SRH crucial victories in their run to the playoffs; his 64 against Punjab Kings helped SRH win by one run, while his unbeaten 76 against Rajasthan Royals ensured a two-run win.Sreshth Shah"

- An elegant left-hand top-order batter, Karnataka's Devdutt Padikkal was picked up at the auction ahead of IPL 2020 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).
- Padikkal racked up 473 runs in his first IPL season and won the award for best emerging player.
- He followed that up with another 400-plus IPL season for RCB, scoring a century in the tournament as well - 101* in 52 balls against Rajasthan Royals.
- RCB, however, released Padikkal after that and RR bought him at the auction prior to IPL 2022. However, playing in the middle order as opposed to his preferred opening role, he could not replicate his success from previous years, scoring 376 runs from 17 innings.
- He had another lean season with RR in 2023, scoring 261 runs from 11 innings, and was traded to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) ahead of IPL 2024.
Devdutt Padikkal player profile
Padikkal first came to attention in 2020 as a 20-year-old after a breakout domestic season where he was the top run-getter in both white-ball tournaments, and then winning the emerging-player award in his debut IPL season, racking up 473 runs. At 6ft 3in, left-hander Padikkal, primarily an opener, is able to use his height and reach to meet good-length balls on the rise. He took his first-season form into the 2020-21 Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he became the first Indian batter to score four consecutive List A hundreds. He made over 400 runs in the 2021 IPL as well, and it led to an India call-up, in Sri Lanka. But just when Padikkal's career was taking off, an acute intestinal issue struck him, affecting his form and fitness for two years. After two middling seasons with Rajasthan Royals, where he shuttled up and down the order, he was traded to Lucknow Super Giants ahead of the 2024 IPL. He found his feet again just before that, becoming Karnataka's top run-getter in the 2023-24 Vijay Hazare Trophy and following it up with four hundreds in six first-class games."
"Pandya, HH",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/hardik-pandya-625371,"Hardik Pandya player profile
Allrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball.
Hardik, who plays his domestic cricket for Baroda, first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL. That began a long association with Mumbai, where he won four trophies and gained acclaim as a formidable finisher. By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he had come to be seen as a future India captain, thanks to the leadership skills he showed that year in turning an unfancied Gujarat Titans line-up into IPL champions in their first year of existence.
Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia, before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in India's squad for that year's T20 World Cup.
While Hardik batted only twice in the tournament, he bowled the last over against Bangladesh, defending two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after that, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no-ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped eventual champions West Indies clinch the semi-final.
Since then, it has not been all smooth sailing. The impact of a serious back injury in 2018 continues to follow Hardik, sometimes limiting him from being able to bowl. And early in 2019, he was embroiled in controversy when he made misogynistic and racist remarks on a talk show, for which he was pulled up by the Indian board.
In the 2020s, Hardik grew into his role as a senior player and won praise for his faith in players as a captain and for being a free-thinker. In 2022, after India beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, he said he wouldn't have minded losing because the match was so much fun - sentiments he echoed after the 2023 IPL final, where he was all praise for rival captain MS Dhoni, whose Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans for the title. That year, like in the one before, Hardik turned in an impressive all-round and captaincy performance, making 346 runs and taking nine wickets in Gujarat Titans' run to their second final in a row.
Hardik Pandya IPL factfile
- Hardik Pandya is part of a rare species in Indian cricket - a genuine seam-bowling allrounder - and he was unearthed byMumbai Indians(MI) in IPL 2015.
- Hardik spent his first seven IPL seasons at Mumbai, developing into one of the world's best allrounders, and was part of their title wins in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. After injuries began to hinder his ability to bowl, Hardik was released by Mumbai after the 2021 season.
- Ahead of IPL 2022, Hardik was signed by new franchise Gujarat Titans (GT) and was appointed their captain even though he had never led any team previously. In his first season as captain, Hardik led Titans to the IPL title and then captained them to the final once again in IPL 2023.
- After two successful years at Titans, Hardik was traded back to Mumbai ahead of IPL 2024, and he was appointed MI captain, replacing long-time leader Rohit Sharma.
- Hardik's best season as an allrounder was in IPL 2019, when he scored 402 runs at a strike rate of 191.41 and took 14 wickets in Mumbai's title-winning campaign. In 2022, he was the highest run-scorer (487) for Titans as they won their maiden IPL title."
"Pant, RR",https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/rishabh-pant-931581,"Rishabh Pant player profile
A match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team.
His first Test century came in his third match, on the 2018 tour of England, when he made 114 from No. 7 when up against a target of 464 that he made look almost gettable at points when he was at the crease. Early the following year he produced 159 off 189 balls in India's total of 622 in Sydney, which sealed their first series win in Australia. An encore followed early in 2021, when he made 97 off just 118 at the SCG, helping wrest a draw off Starc, Cummins, Lyon and Hazlewood when India were staring down the barrel.
Pant's finest batting hour came in the classic that followed in Brisbane: an unbeaten 89 to steer a veritable India third XI home in a tall chase, and to their second series win down under in two visits. The whitewash of England at home that followed brought another two centuries for him, and in Cape Town at the start of 2022, he made an almost ludicrous 100 off 139 in an India total where the next highest score was 29. Later that year, he set India up with a breakneck 146 in the first innings of the postponed last Test of their tour of England from 2021 - only for England to outgun them in a berserker fourth-innings chase.
In December 2022, Pant was seriously injured in a horrific car crash but he returned to the game 15 months later, in the 2024 IPL, leaner and more fit, his attacking fervour undiminished.
It is a mark of Pant's no-fear, no-brakes batting that in his first four years in the game, he had as many scores between 90 and 100 in Tests as he did hundreds. It is the only way he has known: a year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at 18 in 2015, he scored a triple-hundred against Maharashtra, followed by two blistering centuries in a game against Jharkhand a month on - one of them ending in 135 off 67 balls.
With Test stats like his, Pant's numbers in T20 - over 3000 runs in eight seasons for Delhi Capitals, at a strike rate of close to 150 - don't seem especially remarkable, but he has been a force for the Delhi side, their all-time top-scorer, and was appointed captain in 2021. He was bought at auction by the franchise the day he made a hundred in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, which took India into the semi-finals of that tournament.
Rishabh Pant IPL factfile
- Rishabh Pant was bought by DC at the 2016 IPL auction, on the same day that he scored a century to seal India's place in the Under-19 World Cup semi-final, and he has remained with them ever since.
- An attacking left-hand wicketkeeper-batter, Pant made a name for himself with his audacious stroke play and daredevil approach. His best season with the bat was in IPL 2018, when he scored 684 runs at a strike rate of 173.60.
- In IPL 2019, Pant was DC's second highest run-scorer - 488 at a strike rate of 162.66 - as they qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2012.
- Pant was named DC's captain for IPL 2021, when Shreyas Iyer was injured, and had led the team to the top of the points table at the halfway stage before the season was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. When the season resumed later in 2021, DC decided to continue with Pant as their captain.
- Pant returned to play IPL 2024 after recovering from severe injuries he suffered in a life-threatening car accident in December 2022. He was named captain of Delhi Capitals again after his return, and, back to his best, made 446 runs in yet another middling season for the team."

- That season, he became the youngest IPL half-centurion at 17 years and 175 days when he hit a 49-ball 50 against Delhi Capitals.
- Tasked with the role of finisher, Parag found little success in his first five seasons. Ahead of IPL 2022, Royals bought Parag back for INR 3.8 crore, but he managed just 183 runs in 14 innings at an average of 16.64 and strike rate of 138.64. But having been identified as a future star, Parag continued to receive the franchise's backing.
- In the 2023-24 Indian domestic season, he seemed to turn a corner. He hit 510 runs at a strike rate of 182.79 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s for Assam. This included seven back-to-back half-centuries. He was also the highest six-hitter at the 50-over Deodhar Trophy, the inter-zonal tournament. And the form extended into IPL 2024, where in the first half of the tournament he was constantly in contention for the Orange Cap.
Riyan Parag player profile
Parag, a batting allrounder from Assam, impressed as an Under-19 player during India's 2017 tour of England, playing alongside Shubman Gill and Prithvi Shaw, among others - he scored three fifties in four innings in the four-dayers. That Indian team went on to win the 2018 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, but Parag only scored 17 runs in the two innings he got to play while also picking up three wickets.
Before IPL 2019, Parag was bought by Rajasthan Royals for his base price of INR 20 lakh and has been with them since. That season, he became the youngest (at the time) to hit an IPL fifty.
A lean phase followed, but he reinvented his batting and came out more confident in 2023, winning the Player-of-the-Series award in the 2023 Deodhar Trophy List A tournament - he was the highest run-getter, the highest six-hitter, and had the third-highest number of wickets.
In the 2023-24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20s, he was again the highest run-getter and highest six-hitter. The same season, Parag hit the second-fastest Ranji Trophy century ever, getting there in 56 balls against Chhatisgarh."
